# wally-site

The front-end for wally, built on [react and redux](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit).

## Requirements
* node `^4.2.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

## Getting Started

After confirming your environment meets the [requirements](#requirements), follow these steps to get the project up and running:

```bash
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

Head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.|
|`compile`|Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but enables nodemon for the server as well.|
|`dev:no-debug`|Same as `npm run dev` but disables devtool instrumentation.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`deploy`|Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.|
|`deploy:dev`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "development".|
|`deploy:prod`|Same as `deploy` but overrides `NODE_ENV` to "production".|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).|

## Application Structure

Functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type.

## Development

#### Developer Tools

Using the [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) is recommended.

### Routing
We use `react-router` [route definitions](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#plainroute) (`<route>/index.js`) to define units of logic within our application. See the [application structure](#application-structure) section for more information.

## Testing
To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. If using `redux-cli`, test files should automatically be generated when you create a component or redux module.

Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default.

## Deployment
Out of the box, this is deployable by serving the `~/dist` folder generated by `npm run deploy` (referencing the `NODE_ENV`).

## Build System

### Configuration

Default project configuration can be found in `~/config/index.js`.

For environment-specific overrides see `~/config/environments.js`.

|Key|Description|
|---|-----------|
|`dir_src`|application source code base path|
|`dir_dist`|path to build compiled application to|
|`server_host`|hostname for the Koa server|
|`server_port`|port for the Koa server|
|`compiler_css_modules`|whether or not to enable CSS modules|
|`compiler_devtool`|what type of source-maps to generate (set to `false`/`null` to disable)|
|`compiler_vendor`|packages to separate into to the vendor bundle|

### Globals

These are global variables available to you anywhere in your source code. If you wish to modify them, they can be found as the `globals` key in `~/config/index.js`. When adding new globals, make sure you also add them to `~/.eslintrc`.

|Variable|Description|
|---|---|
|`process.env.NODE_ENV`|the active `NODE_ENV` when the build started|
|`__DEV__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`|
|`__PROD__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`|
|`__TEST__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `test`|
|`__DEBUG__`|True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development` and cli arg `--no_debug` is not set (`npm run dev:no-debug`)|
|`__BASENAME__`|[history basename option](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/BasenameSupport.md)|

### Styles

Both `.scss` and `.css` file extensions are supported and configured to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). After being imported, styles will be processed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for minification and autoprefixing, and will be extracted to a `.css` file during production builds.

### Server

Koa server is included to provide `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware` for hot module replacement in place of [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).

### Production Optimization

Babel is configured to use [babel-plugin-transform-runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-runtime) so transforms aren't inlined. Additionally, in production, we use [react-optimize](https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-react-optimize).

In production, webpack will extract styles to a `.css` file, minify your JavaScript, and perform additional optimizations such as module de-duplication.
